# TASKS

Track the work planned or completed inside this session. Update it as you queue new jobs or finish steps so the workspace history stays clear.

- [x] Describe the immediate objective for this session
  - Clarify deliverables for documenting the OpenAI Community Forum MCP server and ensure TASKS.md reflects current progress.
- [x] Capture any commands or scripts that should be replayed later
  - `ls`
  - `cat TASKS.md`
  - `pip install --user "mcp[cli]" uvicorn starlette httpx`
  - `python3 -m compileall server.py tools resources`
  - `python3 - <<'PY' ...` (ad-hoc async smoke tests for `list_latest_topics` and `search_forum`)
- [x] Log blockers or dependencies discovered during the run
  - None encountered; resources already present in the workspace.
- [x] Summarize results before closing the session
  - Recorded objectives, commands, and status so future work can proceed with full context.

Feel free to expand this checklist to match your project.


## MCP Implementation Tasks

- [x] Initialize a Python project with `pyproject.toml` and add dependencies: `mcp[cli]`, `uvicorn`, `starlette`, `httpx`.
- [x] Scaffold the code layout: `server.py`, `tools/`, `resources/`, aligning with the documented project structure.
- [x] Implement a FastMCP-based Streamable HTTP server mounted at `/mcp` and configure it to run on port 3000.
- [x] Wire up CORS middleware to expose the `Mcp-Session-Id` header for browser clients.
- [x] Build a Discourse API client layer using `httpx` for endpoints `/latest.json`, `/top.json`, `/search.json`, `/t/<id>.json`, `/categories.json`, `/tags.json`, `/site.json`.
- [x] Register MCP tools: `list_latest_topics`, `list_top_topics`, `get_topic`, `search_forum`, `list_categories`, `list_tags`, `get_site_info`.
- [x] Provide MCP resources for categories, tags, and site metadata snapshots.
- [x] Add developer run/test guidance (e.g., MCP Inspector usage) referencing the port 3000 server.
